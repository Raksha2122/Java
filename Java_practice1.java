//Type of Languages 
// procedural series of well structured steps. eg java, python  
// functional writing in pure functions, and you can use that many types, perform lot of operation with same datasets, First class function- reassigning eg python 
// oject oriented (code+data = object),revolves around objects eg java, c++,python etc

//static vs dynamic 
// static perform type checking at compile time 
// error will show at compile time 
// declear datatype before you use it 
// more 

// dynamic perform type checking at runtime 
// error might not show till program is run 
//no need to declear datatype of variable 
// saves time in writing code but might give error at runtime 

//Two type of memory 
// stack variable is stored here 
// heap value of real object is stored here 
// a is the stack memory pointing to words the object in the heap memory a=10
// a=[1,3,5,9]
//b=a
// update a=[99,3,5,9]
// o/p print b  o/p= [99,3,5,9]

//How java code executes 
//.java file (human readable)/ source code ---compiler--> .class file / byte code --- interpreter -->machine code (0 and 1)
// this code will not directly run on the system 
// we need java virtual machine to run it 

// how java is platform independance 
// byte code can run on all operating systems 
// in java we get bytecode JVM converts this to machine code 
// java is platform independent but JVM is platfrom dependent 

//JDK java devlopment kit provides enviroment to develop and run the java program 
// pack that include JRE to execute ur program, a compiler , archiver , docs generator , interpreter
// JRE installation package that provides environment to only run the program

// JAVA source code --->JDK [COMPLIER] --> BYTECODE --->JVM-----> JRE [JVM +HARDWare]
system.out.print("Hello");
